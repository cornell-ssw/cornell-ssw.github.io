title: Notes from first meeting
---

David Bindel gave an [opening spiel](slides/2016-09-12-spiel.html) on
the club and its purpose.  A page was passed around to collect netids in
order to set up accounts on our local instructional cluster (Totient).

Stephen McDowell spoke about basics of working at the terminal in
Unix/Linux (the environment on Totient and the default environment for
interacting with many other cloud and HPC resources).
Stephen's talk was based on slides from a half-semester course that
he taught this spring, [CS 2043](http://cs2043-sp16.github.io/).
Eric Lee spoke about setting up the terminal for Windows environments
(slides to be posted).
