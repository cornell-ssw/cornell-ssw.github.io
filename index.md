The purpose of the Cornell Scientific Software Club is to learn about
modern tools relevant for developing and deploying scientific codes.
Researchers from all areas of computational science and engineering
are welcome.  The planned meeting time is Mondays at 6 pm,
starting on 2016-09-12 (the Monday after Labor Day) in Gates 122.
We have a list of [planned topics][plans],
but so far no specific schedule.

If you are interested in participating, please

participation will help us in making room requests and securing funding
and resources (e.g. cloud computing cycles).
