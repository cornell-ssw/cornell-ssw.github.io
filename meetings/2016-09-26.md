# Minimalist Bash Scripting
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bash scripting can get somewhat complicated if you want to use it as a tool for
processing.  However, if you just need a simple script to submit jobs to a
cluster, there are only a few key items you need to know.

1. You can create local variables in your script.  Like other scripting
   languages, types of variables are implicit.  You can use a variable as a
   string, and then later set it to a number.

   ```bash
   # Create a string variable
   MY_STR="Some thing"
   # Create an integer
   MY_INT=12
   # Create a real number
   MY_DEC=12.21
   ```
2. You can dereference the value of a variable by prefixing a `$` to the name of
   the variable.  The following will all print the value of each variable to the
   console:

   ```bash
   # Printing the local variables define above
   echo "The string is: $MY_STR"
   echo "The integer is: $MY_INT"
   echo "The real number is: $MY_DEC"
   # You also have access to the many 'environment variables'
   echo "The current working directory is: $PWD"
   echo "The C compiler you have set is: $CC"
   echo "The shell you are using is: $SHELL"
   ```

   _Note_: if the `C` compiler line did not print anything for `$CC`, then you
           have not set this environment variable.  That is not a problem.
3. Bash is particularly sensitive about whitespace.

   ```bash
   # Whitespace around the equals sign will break
   MY_VAR = "Some value"
   ```
4. There is a difference between single and double quotes.  In single quotes,
   special characters (`\`, `$`, `!`, `?`, and `*` are some) are used literally.
   In double quotes, they keep their special meaning.

   **Using double quotes**:

   ```bash
   VAR="The string $MY_STR is not equal to $MY_INT."
   echo "$VAR"
   ```
   will print `The string Some thing is not equal to 12.` to the console.

   **Using single quotes**:

   ```bash
   VAR='The string $MY_STR is not equal to $MY_INT.'
   echo "$VAR"
   ```
   will print `The string $MY_STR is not equal to $MY_INT.` to the console.

   **Note 1:**

   Even the syntax highlighting for the above is different, most text editors do
   this as well.  Generally you will be fine using **double** quotes.  When
   writing more complicated scripts, it is useful to know that you can bypass
   special characters (if you have used `sed`, you have fought this before).

   **Note 2:**

   Whitespace revisited.  You have access to the same `printf` function as `C`
   in your shell.  If we do

   ```bash
   VAR="The string $MY_STR is not equal to $MY_INT."
   printf "%s\n" "$VAR"
   ```

   it will work.  However, if we change it to

   ```bash
   VAR="The string $MY_STR is not equal to $MY_INT."
   printf "%s\n" $VAR
   ```

   it will perform differently.  This is another example of the sensitivity of
   whitespace in Bash.  When you have `"$VAR"`, putting it inside the double
   quotes says 'form this as a single entity'.  When you have `$VAR`, the
   contents are expanded as is.  Since there were spaces in the original string,
   they are now treated as separate arguments.  `printf` will complain because
   there are now more arguments being supplied than format specifiers (`%s` in
   this case).

    <div id="qsubcommand" class="panel-collapse collapse">
      <div class="panel-body">
        <p><tt>qsub [opts] &lt;job-script.pbs&gt;</tt></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Usually, the majority of the work is done by <tt>job-script.pbs</tt></li>
          <li>
            Read the man page!  There are a lot of important environment
            variables that <tt>qsub</tt> defines for the script.
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>The one you will use most frequently: <tt>$PBS_O_WORKDIR</tt></li>
            <li>
              E.g. <tt>cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR</tt> in the script so the executable
              can be found
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            The other common argument you will use is the <tt>-v</tt> flag,
            which allows you to supply arguments to the job script.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

The best way to understand how this all works is by running through some examples!
To start, we will run through examples 1, 2, and 3 in the [example repository](https://github.com/cornell-ssw/Totient-Demo).

# Bash Scripting Revisited
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now that you know how to use `qsub`, the next thing you will probably want to
be able to do is supply arguments to your PBS script.  Ordinarily, when you want
to use command-line arguments in Bash you can refer to them using

<center>
<div class="table-responsive">
    <table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
      <colgroup>
        <col class="col-xs-2">
        <col class="col-xs-10">
      </colgroup>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Variable</th>
          <th>Value</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tr>
        <td><tt>$0</tt></td>
        <td>The name of the script.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><tt>$1</tt></td>
        <td>The first command-line argument.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><tt>$2</tt></td>
        <td>The second command-line argument.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><tt>...</tt></td>
        <td>...</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><tt>$n</tt></td>
        <td>The nth command-line argument.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><tt>$*</tt></td>
        <td>All command line arguments concatenated.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><tt>$@</tt></td>
        <td>The command line arguments as an array.</td>
      </tr>
