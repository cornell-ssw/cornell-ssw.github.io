**Abstract**:

_Running simulations to verify results is important in research, and usually you
get to see pretty graphs and such in computational papers. We'll cover some tips
and tricks on what goes behind this process - modularization of code; debugging
heuristics; making preliminary plots; optimizing large scale simulations and
more._

## Additional Materials

Keegan has prepared some sample `R` programs:

1. [`demo_1.r`](demo_1.r)
2. [`demo_2.r`](demo_2.r)
3. [`integral.r`](integral.r)

He also has some code samples available [on his GitHub](https://github.com/erwin4d/research_projects).
