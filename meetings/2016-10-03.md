**Abstract**:

_Python caught on as a language for steering computational science
applications long before it enjoyed its current mainstream popularity. Today,
Python has a mature ecosystem of tools for writing and interacting with
high-performance codes, and IPython/Jupyter notebooks are an increasingly common
method of developing and documenting analyses.  In this talk, we will discuss
Python for computational science, including some of the standard scientific
software packages available in Python.  We will also show off the Jupyter
notebook, including a demonstration of how to use Jupyter to interact with
parallel jobs run on a cluster._
