# An Introduction to Julia
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Presentation courtesy of Madeleine Udell.

**Abstract**:

_Julia is a truly modern language, rich with features that enable both productivity
and performance.  Julia uniquely joins the convenience of languages such as MATLAB,
R, and Python, with the performance benefits of C and Fortran.  Julia has an active
community and is rapidly evolving, but in this talk you will see why you should
give it a chance even if it isn't officially 1.0 yet.  After a brief introduction
to getting started with the language, a discussion of thread control and other
more advanced topics will be covered._
