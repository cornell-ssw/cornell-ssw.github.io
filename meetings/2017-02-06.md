**Abstract**:

_D3.js (or Data Driven Documents) is a JavaScript library for programming 
interactive visualizations that can be easily shared as web pages. It is widely
used and highly regarded; its user base includes The New York Times and The
Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Harnessing the good parts of
JavaScript, it allows for flexible visualizations specified by concise programs.
In this talk, I will present an overview of the library, as well as a brief
introduction to Three.js, another JavaScript library more suited to 3D
visualizations._
