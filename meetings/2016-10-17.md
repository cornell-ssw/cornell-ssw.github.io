**Abstract**:

_You have a week until the deadline, and simulations that would take two weeks
to run on your laptop.  Or you have a problem you want to solve, if you only had
enough memory on your desktop.  Where should you run your computation?  Should
you apply for time on a supercomputer, look for a local cluster, or dive into
the buzzword-laden world of VMs, Docker, and XaaS?  This week, we give a
panoramic overview of servers, clusters, clouds, and supercomputers, discussing
some performance realities and myths associated with each.  We also discuss the
problem of how to set up a consistent environment across many platforms, and
describe the concept of virtualization: of environments, languages, hardware,
and operating systems._
