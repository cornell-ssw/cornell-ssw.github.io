# Workflow and Build Automation

## with Make and Company

Presentation courtesy of David Bindel.

**Abstract**:

_One of the great early successes of the Unix world was Make, a system for
automating the steps to build software.  Come see how build tools like Make and
more flexible successors (such as Rake, SnakeMake, and PyDoIt), can help you
automate not only the steps to build software but also to build documents and
run data analysis._
