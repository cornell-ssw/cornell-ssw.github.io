# Databases and Large-scale Data Analytics

Presentation courtesy of Rachit Agarwal.

**Abstract**:

_One problem many face when developing and maintaining software is how to best manage
data. This is especially important when said data is computationally expensive to
produce.  Managing a high volume of data well leads to not only simplified workflow but
also more transparent code bases. In this light, we will be giving a high-level
introduction to database systems. We will discuss open-source systems for large-scale
data analytics. The discussion will primarily focus on functionality, performance
tradeoffs and use cases for systems that are widely used in the real-world._
