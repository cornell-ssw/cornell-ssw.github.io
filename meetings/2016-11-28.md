**Abstract**:

_Ever found that great new library that will solve all your problems?  Ever
abandoned it because you couldn't figure out how to use it, possibly even
reimplementing it yourself?  Don't let that be your library!_

_Never before have you had two speakers more enthusiastic about code documentation,
and we're going to show you how easy and fun it can be to polish your awesome code
with documentation._

- _Automatic documentation generation, triggered after each commit,_
- _Modern look and feel, complete with LaTeX equations and mobile support by default,_
- _Pointers to where you can host your documentation for free,_
- _and more!_

_If this sounds boring to you, we challenge you to come and see what the autodoc
world has to offer._
