# Docker and Deep Learning
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Presentation courtesy of Bennett Wineholt.

**Abstract**:

_Scaling up systems for resource-intensive machine learning tasks demands
convenient methods to manage computations distributed across multiple servers.
Come and learn about both the processes underlying new Deep Learning techniques
that have been applied to piloting drones and driving autonomous vehicles as
well as the Docker containerization tools used to train these systems at scale._

# How To
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Docker and Deep Learning on your laptop
    - [Install Docker](#install-docker)
    - [Start Docker](#start-docker)
    - [Pull Docker container from Docker Hub](#pull-docker-container-from-docker-hub)
    - [Run the Container](#run-the-container)
    - [Run Deep Learning on the Container](#run-deep-learning-on-the-container)
    - [Shut it Down](#shut-it-down)

### Install Docker

- Visit [https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
  and pick your operating system.
    - [https://www.docker.com/community-edition ](https://www.docker.com/community-edition )

### Start Docker

You may need to run the Docker application, or the command

```bash
$ sudo service docker start
```

A reboot may be required since Docker ties tightly into system functions.

### Pull Docker container from Docker Hub

- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is a widely used learning toolset,
  so we will be working with the
  [TensorFlow docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/tensorflow/tensorflow/).

  ```bash
  $ docker pull tensorflow/tensorflow
  ```

### Run the Container

Now that we have downloaded a docker container, the next step is to run it:

```bash
$ docker run -it -p 8888:8888 tensorflow/tensorflow
```

### Run Deep Learning on the Container

Go to your browser on [`http://localhost:8888/`](http://localhost:8888/) (the
command printed on container start).  Consider reading the MNIST from Scratch
jupyter notebook comments to get a good idea of the steps involved.

Use the MNIST from Scratch jupyter notebook to execute the code, running
commands with `Shift+Enter` or `Cell -> Run All`.

- **Warning**: Step 22 Training is _slow_.  About 10 minutes on 8 core cpu (2GHz i7) 16G RAM
- **Warning**: Plots in Step 23 seem to be bugged and crash the notebook kernel

### Shut it Down

- When finished, exit your browser window.
- In a terminal list running containers:

  ```bash
  $ docker ps
  ```

    - The previous command will list any / all container id's presently running on your computer.
    - Take the `container_id`(s) you want to shut down and use it to stop the containers, then remove them permanently

      ```bash
      $ docker stop container_id
      $ docker rm container_id
      ```

- Then shut down Docker; based on your OS there may be a service icon, or try
  the Linux command (your Linux OS may or may not be using `service`, but it is
  more likely it is than not):

  ```bash
  $ sudo service docker stop
  ```
