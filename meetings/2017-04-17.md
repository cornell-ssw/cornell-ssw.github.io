**Abstract**:

_Scaling up systems for resource-intensive machine learning tasks demands
convenient methods to manage computations distributed across multiple servers.
Come and learn about both the processes underlying new Deep Learning techniques
that have been applied to piloting drones and driving autonomous vehicles as
well as the Docker containerization tools used to train these systems at scale._
