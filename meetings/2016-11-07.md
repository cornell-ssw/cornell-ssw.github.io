**Abstract**:

_R is a programming language that is widely used in academia and industry for
statistical computing.  It has been particularly enhanced within the past year
with stable releases of packages for reshaping large, complex datasets into
structures that are easy to work with and creating beautiful visualizations.
We will demonstrate these newer features as well as some of R's powerful core
functions for creating linear/nonlinear models, conducting statistical tests,
and performing simulations.  We will also discuss the advantages of R relative
to other languages which are used widely in scientific computing._
