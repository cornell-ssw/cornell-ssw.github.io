# Cloud Computing with AWS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Presentation courtesy of Zhiming Shen and Weijia Song.

**Abstract**:

_In this talk, we are going to give an introduction to Amazon AWS -- the biggest
and most widely used cloud computing platform. We are going to show live demos
of allocating, connecting, and using different AWS services including virtual
machines (EC2), storage (S3), databases (RDS), and distributed computation
platforms (Elastic MapReduce) etc._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Getting Started

Zhiming began by presenting an overview of the inner workings of the AWS platform.

## Jumping In

Weijia followed by presenting more in-depth use cases of the AWS platform,
including a demonstration of how to use AWS to perform MapReduce conveniently
and succinctly in 80 lines of Java code or less -- much of which was your
obligatory I/O code!
