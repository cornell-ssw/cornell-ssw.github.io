# Mixing Languages in Scientific Codes

**Abstract**:

_Different languages are favored by different computational scientists for good reason:
Fortran for legacy and speed, C/C++ for large frameworks and fast kernels, Julia and
MATLAB and Python and R for their array syntax and ease of use.  But when your
simulation framework is in C++, you want to call some old solvers written in Fortran,
and the student working with you mostly knows Python or MATLAB, how can you manage it
all?  In this talk, we discuss some techniques and challenges of mixed language
programming, with a particular emphasis on "front-end / back-end" combinations where
high-level logic is written in a language like MATLAB or Python and the computational
kernels are written in a compiled language._
