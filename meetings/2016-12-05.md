**Abstract**:

_The recently introduced Intel Xeon Phi "Knights Landing" (KNL) is one of the most
anticipated processors to enter the HPC market. With a design that puts a heavy
emphasis on floating-point throughput, it is clearly targeted at the scientific
computing community (and relatives). KNL has two big advantages: it is a
full-fledged x86_64 processor, and it can be programmed in standard compiled
languages such as C/C++ and Fortran. However, it takes some doing to realize the
advertised performance._

_For this meeting we will start with an overview of KNL's unique features and
their implications for programs. The presentation will be followed by a hands-on
session with "Stampede Upgrade", a cluster of 504 KNL nodes at the Texas Advanced
Computing Center (TACC). The short exercises will illustrate the importance of
vectorization in codes that will run well on current and future processor
architectures._
